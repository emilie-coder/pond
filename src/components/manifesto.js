        Freedom. This one single word defines us.
        Whether up-and-coming or established, musicians are invariably bound by the traditional practices of the industry.
        You tailor your music to fit streaming platforms' algorithms; you negotiate with your record label on what songs get to be produced;
        you lack creative ways to share your music. We help you focus on the art and keep the lionâ€™s share of the sales.
        At Pond, we help you reclaim control of your creativity by leveraging endless possibilities brought by NFT and Web3 technologies.
        We listen to your story and your fans. We help you launch your NFT project, from planning to implementation, with you having the final say in every step of the way.
